# Forget-Me-Not ðŸŒ·
Forget-Me-Not is an iOS app for mental health management based on my own personal 
experiences with navigating the mental healthcare system. The app features tools 
for stress management and tracking progress along the journey to wellness and is 
best used in tandem with cognitive behavioral therapy. While its target user is 
a person with a bipolar/major depressive disorder diagnosis, we encourage its use 
in all people -- we could all benefit from a reminder that taking care of our mental 
health is not something to forget!  

## Features
Planned features include:
- Dashboard for viewing mood trends, user activity, and progress
    - Dashboard data can be exported and shared with counselors or loved ones to share progress
- Mood entry that takes into account both energy levels and mood pleasantness
- Journaling to reflect and identify both positive and negative triggers
- A continuously growing list of self-care practices e.g. grounding exercises for anxiety
- Daily "missions" to encourage beneficial pratices e.g. expressing gratitude to a loved one
- Medication reminders and information storage to aid in psychiatry
